            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>We met while we were both serving missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Las Vegas, NV. Liam had been there for about six months when we first met. I had been serving in Nauvoo, IL at the historic sites, and was only in Vegas for the winter while Nauvoo was quiet. We ended up in the same zone for a solid five months and we became good friends. A week after I got home, we went on our first date. We each drove about three hours to meet up in Columbus, OH, halfway between our homes of Pittsburgh, PA, and Indianapolis, IN. We did that once a week for the next three months until we both went back to college. Liam went to BYU-I in Rexburg, ID, and I headed to Utah State University in Logan, UT. We had the privilege of spending weekends together rather than just one day. We got engaged about a month after I moved to Utah. We got married in May 2021, and since then, we've lived in three different states and held nine jobs between the two of us. We like to play games, spend time outside, and watch movies together. </p>

            <h2>What We're Up to Now</h2>
            <p> We live in a small, old apartment on campus that we love, even though our washer is in our bathroom and our dryer is on our back porch. We've both been working while I finish up my last semester at USU. Liam's a technical support representative at Juniper Systems and I'm an IT security technician and data analytics teaching assistant at USU. I'll be graduating very soon in information systems with an emphasis on cybersecurity and Liam is working on enrolling in online school. We're enjoying the last bit of time feeling like kids before our life completely changes. We're so excited to become parents to our little baby Bread. Beyond school and work, we're just trying to prepare for having a baby, moving, and adjusting to a new way of life.</p>

            <h2>Next Plans</h2>
            <p>Between graduating in May and having a baby in August, we have a lot of big changes coming up. We'll be moving to Indiana the first week of May so I can start my new job as a junior security analyst for the Legislative Services Agency. We don't know where we will live yet, but we have a trip planned next week to scout out housing. Liam is planning to start school in June, and he may also work, but we haven't decided on that yet. Once baby comes, Liam will be the full-time parent while doing school and I continue to work. Liam's going to be such a good dad and we are going to love this baby more than anything. It'll be an adjustment to swap roles so completely from what they are now. I've always been in school and Liam has usually been the one to leave the house and go to work. We think it will be fun, though, and we're excited for this new chapter of our lives. I mean, come on! We're about to have a baby! Who wouldn't be excited for that? </p>
