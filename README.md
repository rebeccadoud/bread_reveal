# Time to find out what Bread really is!

Just kidding. We know Bread is a baby. Obviously. But, this code will create a super awesome website that will let everyone know if Bread is a boy or a girl! Yay.

Hosted through AWS S3 Bucket. Using domain name babybread.click. Rerouted it to our S3 Bucket using AWS Route 53, so users can go to babybread.click or www.babybread.click and they'll see the page.

This source code is terribly organized, but it's okay. Liam and I created this website during a 24 hour hackathon at USU. Neither of us have experience with web development, and we learned everything we needed just during the hackathon. We did end up going a little longer than the 24 hours. We started discussing the website, learning to code in CSS/HTML, and coming up with a web design around 5 pm on Friday night (3/24/23). We showed the website to our families on Sunday evening (3/26/23). We worked through most of the first 24 hours, but then we had to get back to normal life so we did not work straight for the next 24 hours. This project was super nerdy and super fun. We weren't originally going to do any sort of gender reveal, but this silly idea came to me and Liam and I had a blast doing it. I saved all our source code here so you can locally visit the website & we could make improvements to it one day if we ever wanted to. I'm really proud of our work, even though it's simple and not perfect. It was super fun and a great learning experience. We've never worked on anything together like this and I loved the collaborative nature of it.
